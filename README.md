# MiniCalc
Hello! Minicalc is a minimalistic calculator for the pc.
You can type or use the buttons to give an input and the result is calculated
while you type! By hitting enter or the '=' button, you store the calculation,
and up to three recent calculations are stored. Use the 'Clear All' button to
reset everything.


### Bugs
- Not responsive
- Input doesn't show when too large
- Safari: audio doesn't rewind on keydown
- Firefox: typing automatically pops-up the search content bar
- Firefox: backspace auto-directs user to previous page

###Possible future functions:
- auto copy result
- paste numbers
- notify that result is copied
