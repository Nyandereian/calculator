# MiniCalc
Hello! Minicalc is a minimalistic calculator for the pc.
You can type or use the buttons to give an input and the result is calculated
while you type! By hitting enter or the '=' button, you store the calculation,
and up to three recent calculations are stored. Use the 'Clear All' button to
reset everything.


###Possible future functions:
- auto copy result
- paste number
- notify that result is copied
- autosize input font
- make responsive for small devices
